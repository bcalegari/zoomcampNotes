# Project structure

In the course I will try to follow this structure for the projec to keep it clean. 
It will be also easy to check the files without the noisy files I create to test everything.
So this might resemble a final project with everything inside a correct folder.

The commands must be executed in the project root directory (in this case 'learning')
At the moment I separated the directories in: 
* 'docker': contain docker files, and volumes for our test database
* 'pipelines': with the 'notebooks' for testing and visualization and 'python' with the final version of our script to ingest data
* 'resources': data from the internet that i will use in the project
* 'terraform': files for the terraform
